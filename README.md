The sample app that demonstrates using Clean Architecture + MVP.

### üèõ Project Structure

The project contains 3 modules:
- **core** - contains common code for both modules
- **app-coroutines** - Coroutines, Toothpick
- **app-rxjava** - RxJava 2, Dagger 2

This project includes the following libraries, tools and solutions:

- [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/ImangazalievM/CleanArchitectureManifest)
- [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) / [Toothpick](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/toothpick) - for dependency injection
- [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) / [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - for multithreading
- [Moxy](https://github.com/Arello-Mobile/Moxy) - for MVP pattern implementation
- [Alligator](https://github.com/aartikov/Alligator) - for screens navigatio
- [Spek](https://github.com/spekframework/spek) + [MockK](https://github.com/mockk/mockk) + [Strikt](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/) - for unit-tests
- [Kaspresso](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso) - for UI-tests
- Gradle Kotlin DSL

### üå¶ Open Weather API

The app uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for receiving weather forecasts, 
so to build the project you have to provide API key. To do it create account on OpenWeather website,
 then generate your own API key and put it to `open_weather_api_key` property in `api_keys.properties` file.

### ‚ö† Attention:
Clean Architecture approach [recommends](https://github.com/ImangazalievM/CleanArchitectureManifest#repository) us to create interfaces for repositories, so domain layer shouldn't know anything about data layer. The main goal of this rule is ability to test our interactors using simple unit-tests. IMHO, it is redundant because using repositories implementation directly doesn't cause any problems.

### üö¶Ô∏è Tests Runnning

UI and unit-tests are contained in the **app-coroutines** module.

To run unit-tests, you need to setup [Spek Framework](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10915-spek-framework) plugin.
